## Introduction

The autonomous vehicle as a service (AVaaS) is a cloud-based system that aims at the integration between car
manufacturers, autopilot developers, users, and other external service providers to provide value added services of
intelligence quotient (IQ), ethical quotient (EQ), and adversity quotient (AQ).

In this sense, AVaaS do not perform auto pilot functions, such as driving a car autonomously, but provides the
IQ, EQ and AQ value added services to customers. The autonomous driving capabilities are usually deployed locally
in the cars, while AVaaS are extended capabilities that could be deployed in the cloud (or hybrid environments).
