# Autonomous-Vehicle-As-A-Service (AVAAS)

## Introduction

The autonomous vehicle as a service (AVaaS) is a cloud-based system that aims at the integration between car
manufacturers, autopilot developers, users, and other external service providers to provide value added services of
intelligence quotient (IQ), ethical quotient (EQ), and adversity quotient (AQ).

In this sense, AVaaS do not perform auto pilot functions, such as driving a car autonomously, but provides the
IQ, EQ and AQ value added services to customers. The autonomous driving capabilities are usually deployed locally
in the cars, while AVaaS are extended capabilities that could be deployed in the cloud (or hybrid environments).

## Core concepts 

| Concept                          | Definition                
|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------------
|Autonomous Vehicle (AV)           | Are cars that employ sensor, computer, machine learning, or artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems to support automated driving decisions regarding steering, changes in speeds, and monitoring the environment. 
|Auto Pilot (APILOT)               | A subset of an AV, including only the machine learning, or artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems to support automated driving decisions regarding steering, changes in speeds, and monitoring the environment.
|Car manufacturer                  | A company that produces a pre-installed AV containing (a) sensors to monitor the environment, (b) computers providing processing power, and (c) steering and speed change capabilities provided to the computers. For example, Toyota, BMW, or other.
|APILOT developer                  |  Company that develops, and then, provides the APILOT service to be deployed in a pré installed AV. For example, Waymo, Aurora, or other.
|External service provider         | A company providing specialized additional services that are mandatory to offer IQ, EQ and AQ.
|AVaaS user                        | The customer of AVaaS that uses the AVaaS provided services
|AVaaS Employee                    | Internal AVaaS resource that oversees AVaaS’ business processes management and execution.
